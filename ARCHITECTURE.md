# 🏗️ LIA AI Chat Application: Architecture & Flow

## 🧭 Overview
This application is architected for clarity, modularity, and scalability. It separates concerns between a modern React frontend and a robust Node.js/Express backend, communicating via Socket.IO for real-time features.

---

## 🖥️ Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)
- **Directory:** `src/`
- **Key Components:**
  - 🔑 `LoginForm`: Handles authentication and avatar selection
  - 💬 `ChatInterface`: Main chat UI (header, messages, input, user list)
  - 👥 `UserList`, 💬 `MessageList`, 🗨️ `MessageBubble`, 📝 `MessageInput`, 🏷️ `ChatHeader`: Modular subcomponents
- **State Management:**
  - ⚛️ React hooks for local state
  - 🔌 Socket.IO client for real-time events
  - 💾 Session info in `localStorage` for persistence
- **Flow:**
  1. User logs in or is auto-logged in via session
  2. Frontend emits login event to backend
  3. Receives chat history, user list, and real-time updates
  4. UI updates instantly for all users

## 🗄️ Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO)
- **Directory:** `server/`
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 🔐 User authentication (username/password, in-memory for demo)
  - 🗝️ Session management
  - 🕒 Global chat history (in-memory)
  - 🔄 Real-time event handling (user join/leave, messages, typing)
- **Socket.IO Events:**
  - `user_login`, `session_login`, `send_message`, `chat_history`, `users_update`, `user_joined`, `user_left`, `user_typing`
- **Extensibility:**
  - 🗃️ Easily swap in a database for persistent storage
  - 🔗 Ready for private messaging, file uploads, or company SSO

---

## 📈 Scalability & Maintainability
- 🧩 **Separation of concerns:** Clear API between frontend and backend
- 🏗️ **Component modularity:** Each UI feature is a reusable React component
- ⚡ **Real-time architecture:** Socket.IO enables instant updates and is scalable to many users
- 🔒 **Session handling:** Designed for secure, persistent sessions (demo uses in-memory, production should use secure cookies/db)

---

## 🔄 Flow Summary
1. User opens app → connects to backend via Socket.IO
2. Login or auto-login → backend authenticates, sends chat/user data
3. User sends/receives messages in real time
4. All UI and user presence updates are instant and synchronized
